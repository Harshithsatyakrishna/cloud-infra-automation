Day 1:
- Linux VM setup done
- GitHub repo created
- Azure VM accessible via SSH
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 2: 
-Practised Linux commands basics 
- Revised few Cloud Topics 
Q. What is SSH? 
    - Secure Shell helps to connect with you remote desktop 
    - Command Line where you can talk to your OS 
    - Transfer Data securly 
Q. What is NSG? 
    - Network Security Group is a firewall between user and the VM 
    - It has inbound and outbound rules to decide the traffic in and out securly 
Q. Why port 22 is needed? 
    - Port 22 is required because SSH uses TCP port 22 by default to remotely access Linux systems. 
    - If the inbound rule for port 22 is blocked in the NSG, the SSH connection cannot reach the VM.

Day 3:
- Linux + Networking 
  SSH into your Azure Linux VM
    connect from local bash script to the VM 
     bash:- ssh <username>@<public ip>
  Linux Navigation & Files
    * creating check delete files 
         bash:- pwd (Print Working Directory)
                ls(list files & folders in current Directory)
                ls -l(detailed View)
                cd /(Moves you to the root directory)
    * Create Files & Folders
         bash:- mkdir(creates folder)
                cd(Moves into Folder)
                touch(creates file)
                echo "<text> "<filename>(writes text into the file)
                cat <filename>(displays the text in the file)
    * Delete 
         bash:- rm <filename>(deletes only file)
                rm -r<folder>(deletes entire folder)
                
  File Viewing & System Info
    *   bash:-  cat /etc/os-release(Shows linux details,name & version)
                uname -a(shows kernal & system info)
                whoami(Shows which user you are logged in as)
                head /etc/passwd(shows first 10 lines of the file)
                tail /etc/passwd(shows last 10 lines of the file)
  Permissions
    *    - --> normal file 
         d --> directory
         -> -rw-rw-r
             |  |  |
             |  |  ---> others
             |  -------> Group
             ----------->Owner
         In numeric mode, a three-digit value represents specific file permissions (for example, 744.) These are called octal values. 
         The first digit is for owner permissions, the second digit is for group permissions, and the third is for other users. 
         Each permission has a numeric value assigned to it:
        r (read): 4
        w (write): 2
        x (execute): 1
        In the permission value 744, the first digit corresponds to the user, the second digit to the group, and the third digit to others. 
        By adding up the value of each user classification, you can find the file permissions.

        For example, a file might have read, write, and execute permissions for its owner, and only read permission for all other users. That looks like this:

        Owner: rwx = 4+2+1 = 7
        Group: r-- = 4+0+0 = 4
        Others: r-- = 4+0+0 = 4
        The results produce the three-digit value 744.
        You can modify file and directory permissions with the chmod command, which stands for "change mode."
  
  Process & Resource Commands
    * ps -ef(shows all running processes)
      top (live view of system usage)
      df -h (disk usage )
      free -m (memory usage)
      uptime (shows how long server has been running)
  Networking Commands
    * ip a (shows network interfaces & ip addresses(private also))
      ip route(shows routing table)
      ss - tuln(listing ports)
      ping.google.com(test internet connectivity)[* ctrl + C to stop]
      curl.ifconfig.me(shows public ip address)
